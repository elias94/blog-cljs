After reading the last [essay by Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/conformism.html), I could place myself on the right side of the Cartesian draw (independent-minded), exactly on the border between the top and the bottom quadrant. My school career speaks by itself[^1], and by grouping the descriptions of me given by family and friends I know I have characteristics of both types of people described by the article. Dreamer and against the rules from birth, motivated on some topics that I find interesting.

But passive on what? In challenging myself to prove that I could create something good with my hands. Take 30g of laziness and distraction, the biggest problem in our generation, combine it with indecision and loss of interest, add 40g of conventionalism transmitted from people around, mix and decorate to taste with some fear of life-failure. I'm deep down insecure of exposing what I'm doing to the public, I'm scared of the judgment and the loss of credibility.

I haven't tried to prove myself in what I like the most; I know how to do things with computers since 12, I've read literature and articles about tech businesses and I have a problem-solution point of view (also known as Idea) in my daily life. But I never pushed myself to create a startup project.

I always preferred to wait for the best possible idea, knowing that all the big companies haven't started with anything brilliant. When people asked me, with my coding skills and my interest in this field, why I haven't yet tried to create a startup, I always replied blaming the lack of  friends to co-found a society or the wrong place to start this kind of things.

But something is slowly changing. I've quit my good-salary job, I left my apartment and flight to the other side of the world in Australia (thanks to some friends), without a precise plan in my mind. I discovered that traveling alone helps you a lot to better understand both your weakness and your strength, because you're constantly challenged to resolve situation where you can rely only on yourself. I've understood that people around the world have different mental approach regarding for example the family, the daily workload, or the money management. Different from the conventional life-model proposed to me since I was a child. I've decided to lose the stability given to me by playing a role too tight-fitting for me, in a society very conformist but with weaknesses. I've understood that the society itself is effectively created for the upper left quadrant - the aggressively conventional-minded people - and is not that easy to live in for people belonging the other cartesian side.

I've always pursued my independence since the young age, sometimes with difficulties to stay strictly to the rules, and I obtained it totally as soon as I could. Being free and independent is a benefit that I can't give up.

Who would really care about my writings? There are ~500M of blogs out of here, so It's stupid being stopped by the fear of publishing something with my name. And the same think could be applied to a project. I've to try to accomplish some objectives, nothing will happen if I won't succeed because I won't become popular in that case. What I could lose?
