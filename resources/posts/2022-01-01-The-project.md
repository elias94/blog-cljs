title: The project 
---

Let's skip the introduction. In this blog I will start documenting my path to
create **my personal project**.

It will be most likely software related. This is my way to create a project that
I would like to work on in my life.

# Passion and interests

My passion, not the only one, is writing **good software**. And a software to be
good need also to be valuable. At the current state of the art, this means that
a software should bring to the user a real value to improve their life, also in
small things.

I consider myself still a novice, and I want to keep this attitude during all
the process. But I gained some experience during the last years that could help
me in writing code for my project. Is not necessary a requirement knowing how to
code, but I think is valuable to address the goal in a better way and judge the
results achieved step by step.

# Connections

I hope, for real, to make connections during this time. I want to **meet people**
that share similar or totally different ideas, that are interested in my project
or they are running their own. Or everyone else that want to interact with me.

So you can simply drop me an email or find me on social.

(If you're a recruiter, don't waste your time. If I'm looking for a job means
that this project has failed. And in any case be aware that I don't like
oppressive recruiters.)

# Find peace and wonder

It's a sensation in me that I developed some years ago. I really need to do
something more valuable than sitting in my office desk writing code for small
features that will be replaced in a few years. I love computer for the ability
to create everything I want, so the real limit is "my imagination". And I really
need to **work on my own project** for fulfilling that sense in me. The sense of
accomplishment.

# Respectful

I want to create a project that would made me proud of it. And I want to make it
successful not only to deliver a value, but also to **be respectful**. Doesn't
matter what idea I would pursue, if violated this principles.

Respect is for the nature that we are part of, respect for the other people, not
abusing them, not stole their property, not violate their privacy. Users are not
products and natural resources are not a human commodity.

# Transparency

I want to **be transparent** with the readers. So no crap, advertisement or fake
stuff will ever go on this website. I want to present what is really happening
time by time and be as open as possible. All maintaining a respect for my
personal privacy. I don't need and don't want to be "popular".

# How

I will work on a **series of projects** during the course of **this year**. Different
projects just to see if one of those ideas is valuable and keeps me interested.

I will try to detail most of the choices that I will do and problems that I
encounter. I will try to make a journal of this experience and make it fun.

So I won't take the things too seriously
but at the same time put the best of me
to succeed. I want to deliver **professional valuable products**.

# When

Starting today in my **extra time** for the moment. The first step is to find the
first valuable idea that is able to sustain my basic income.

# Why

Has I said I want to fulfill that sense of accomplishment that derive from "doing
what you like". I like writing software, so that is what I can bring as a personal
creation to the society. And at the same time I feel a desire to do my part in
the change that this world need. Issues that our generations are facing are worth our
immediate actions. And the software industry is included.
